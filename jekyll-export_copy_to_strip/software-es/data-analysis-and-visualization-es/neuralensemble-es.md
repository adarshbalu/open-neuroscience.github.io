[Neural Ensemble](http://neuralensemble.org/) is a framework that serves as an umbrella for software development mostly targeting computational and system neurosciences, although they also have software like the [libNeuroML](http://neuralensemble.org/libNeuroML/) that aims at modelling neuronal morphologies, ion channels and so on. All of the software there is written in Python (at least up to when this was written), so another good reason to learn to code it. ðŸ™‚

In short, the framework includes:

[Brian:](http://neuralensemble.org/brian/) A simulator for spike train networks

[LibNeuroML:](http://neuralensemble.org/libNeuroML/) Software to model neurons, ion channels and synapses in 3D structures.

[Neo:](http://neuralensemble.org/neo/) Package for representing data in Python and also reading neurophys. files from several different formats.

[OpenElectrophy:](http://neuralensemble.org/OpenElectrophy/) Built on top of Neo, this is a data analysis software.

[Sumatra:](http://neuralensemble.org/sumatra/) A tracking and managing software for numerical simulations or analyses.
