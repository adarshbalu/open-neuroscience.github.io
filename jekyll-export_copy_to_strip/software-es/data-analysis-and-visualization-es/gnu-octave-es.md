[GNU Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is a high level interpreted language thought for numerical computation. The language itself is quite similar to matlab, so existing programs/scripts should be portable. Here is a bit about the software from the authors themselves:

> Just about everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with music, but it is actually the name of one of the author&#8217;s former professors who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering, and who was also well known for his ability to do quick &#8220;back of the envelope&#8221; calculations. We hope that this software will make it possible for many people to do more ambitious computations just as easily.
