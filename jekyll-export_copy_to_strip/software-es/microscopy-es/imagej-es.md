[ImageJ](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/) is a software for image processing and analysis written in Java. Maybe one of the most established open source science oriented software (it is about 25 years old, and is under constant development), it has several contributed [plugins](http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/index.html) that further increase its capabilities, and being written in Java it runs on all platforms. A small history of this software can be found [here.](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v9/n7/full/nmeth.2089.html)(Unfortunately this page is not open to all).
