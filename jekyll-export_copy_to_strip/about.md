Hi! This website is my first effort in both website creation and promoting open source science. As mentioned before, the more people sticking their noses into science, either to tinkering with their own projects, or &#8220;simply&#8221; by reading current literature and through these methods, better understanding science and seeing its purpose, the better!!

I hope you find the website useful! Drop me a line with ideas, suggestions, criticisms, other open science/projects and suggestions at: openeuroscience(_at)_gmail.com

(remember to replace the _at_ for @ ;)! )
