Hard to believe, but there are actually open source projects for data sharing and analysis. They cover from fMRI to genetic/molecular data and go from &#8220;simply&#8221; turning paper data into images where the brain active regions are mapped, like the [Neurosynth project](http://neurosynth.org) to open databases where anyone can download a data set and analyse it the way they want, which is the case of the [INCF](http://www.incf.org/). In the end both sides win, the side that collected the data, since they have to be mentioned by the people who analysed the data.
