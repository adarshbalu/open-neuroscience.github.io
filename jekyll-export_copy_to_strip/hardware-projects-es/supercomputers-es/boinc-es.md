is a platform for [volunteer computing.](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/trac/wiki/VolunteerComputing) Briefly, volunteer computer is a system where computer processor&#8217;s idle time (those periods where your computer is on, but not being used for anything) is turned into c

alculation time via a custom written software. This idea got a lot of attention with the [seti@home](http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/) project, where the computers of volunteers were transformed into a sort of supercomputer to analyse radio telescope date.

The Boinc project provides a platform where different projects can be created and launched on the [platform&#8217;s website.](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/) Once online, volunteers can decide to which project they want to spare their computer cycles and help crushing numbers. Currently (11/12/14) the platform has about 229,396 active volunteers on 751,864 computers. with a 24-hour average of 8.024 PetaFLOPS. (not bad!)

Projects come from universities as well as private sector and range from medicine and mathematics to games.
