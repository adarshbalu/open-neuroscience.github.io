[The Open bionics project](http://www.openbionics.org/) was inspired by the Yale open hand project, aiming to develop light, affordable, and modular robot hands and myoelectric prosthesis. Also they want to make them easy to replicate using off the shelf materials. On the video below taken from their website you can see the hands in action, either as a prosthesis, or attached to a small drone being operated remotely.
