The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) is the product of a project that searches to spark the interest of kids into things such as programming and hardware developement. The boards are really cheap (starting at around 25â‚¬) although being a complete computer (it can play high definition media and connect to the internet) that runs linux and can easily be used as an environment for learning python, or other programming languages. Even if it is not an open source piece of hardware (due to one of the chips they use in their board), it is still worth mentioning, since this can be an easy, cheap device used to set up a small prototyping rig.
