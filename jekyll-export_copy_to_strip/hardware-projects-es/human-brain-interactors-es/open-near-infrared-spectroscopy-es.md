Togheter with the open EEG projects already listed on this website, [BrainMap](http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2012/pmd68_mab448/pmd68_mab448/index.html) expands the accessible DIY projects for brain activity measurements. This is the conclusion project of Patrick Dear and Mark Bunney Jr. at Cornell university where they used infrared leds to measure differences in blood flow at the scalp and map the motor cortex.
