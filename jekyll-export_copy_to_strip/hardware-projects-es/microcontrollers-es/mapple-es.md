[Maple](http://leaflabs.com/devices/) is a board built by the Leaf labs and is in a way, Arduino&#8217;s stronger brother. The Maple runs an ARM M3 processor at 72 MHz and has more and preciser analog inputs and outputs (they run at a 16 and 12 bit precision respectively) as compared to the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/). Also the board still has the same format as the arduino, meaning that the shields developed by the arduino troop are mostly compatible with the Maple board. Also the programming environment is also compatible with Arduino&#8217;s.
