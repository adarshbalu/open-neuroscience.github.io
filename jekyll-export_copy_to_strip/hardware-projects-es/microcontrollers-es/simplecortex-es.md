The [SimpleCortex](http://www.brc-electronics.nl/) is an initiative from a group of electronics students that felt that the Arduino project missed a few things, such as a debugger, a nicer programming environment and some more &#8220;muscle&#8221;. This board runs at 120 MHz, has more digital IO ports and more analog inputs than the Arduino boards.

Having never used Simplecortex myself I cannot say more about it. But they seem to keep a constant update of the board and it&#8217;s functionalities and also new shields that can be used to expand the board capabilities, such as a LCD shield, that could be used by those neuroscientists working with visual systems.
