Also not less important is the [OpenOptogenetics wiki](http://www.openoptogenetics.org/index.php?title=Main_Page), a website dedicated to sharing knowledge and know how for optogenetics. The project was created in 2010 by  [Guillaume P. Dugué](http://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumedugue) now counting with more than 100 registered users.
