[David Ng](https://plus.google.com/112215345767735991135/posts/VMPQb4Kh2Sh) has created a very interesting design for the PCR machine. Instead of using eppendorfs, he is using teflon tubes and three different heating elements, which allows for cheaper (he has a working PCR machine for 5 dollars!) and faster DNA amplifications.

[Here](https://hackaday.io/project/1864-5-dna-replicator) you can find the project page, with nice description and instructions

Below is a video from David explaining the project:
