The [openEEG](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html) project aims at describing and putting manuals for building a two channel EEG system for about U$200.
  
More on instructions on how to build one, can be found [here](http://openeeg.sourceforge.net/doc/SimpleEEG/).

The latest update on the page seems to be a bit old, but there is a [website](https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/) where one can buy the necessary PCB boards to build the device. They also sell the openEEG [completely assembled](https://www.olimex.com/Products/EEG/OpenEEG/EEG-SMT/open-source-hardware).
