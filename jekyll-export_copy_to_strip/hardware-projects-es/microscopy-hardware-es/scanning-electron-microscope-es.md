Believe it or not, someone ([Ben Krasnow](https://plus.google.com/115054970849159689228/posts)) has actually had the ability to put a scanning electron microscope together and made a &#8220;do it yourself&#8221; project out of it.

!!!Warning!!! The build of such a device can be hazardous if the proper care is not taken!! Electron microscopes deal with extreme high voltages and production of radiation! If you are going to attempt to build and operate one, inform yourself as much as possible before hand and proceed with care!! Also keep in mind that the openeurscience website is working merely as an information hub and can&#8217;t be hel responsible if anything goes wrong!!
