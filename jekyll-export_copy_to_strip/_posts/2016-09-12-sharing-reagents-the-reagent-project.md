[The Reagent Project](http://www.thereagentproject.org/) aims to upcycle reagents that are wasting away in lab fridges around the world. The idea is that researchers share their unused/ no longer necessary reagents with others that have samples but donâ€™t have access to the reagents.<figure id="attachment_1262" style="width: 1500px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
