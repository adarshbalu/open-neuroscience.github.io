Some updates to the website!

Google has created an open source tool box, called [Tensor Flow](http://openeuroscience.com/software/data-analysis-and-visualization/tensor-flow/) containing their deep learning algorithms

[OME](http://openeuroscience.com/software/microscopy/ome-open-microscopy-environment/) is a project concerned with the creation of standard file formats, visualization, and file keeping tools for biological images.

e-health is an open source platform for real time monitoring of biosignals from patients / test subjects. Check it at [interesting projects](http://openeuroscience.com/other-interesting-projects/) (at the bottom of the page).

Bitalino is also listed on the [interesting projects](http://openeuroscience.com/other-interesting-projects/) page, and is similar to e-health, but more focused on prototyping and tinkering.
