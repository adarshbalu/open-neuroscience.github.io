Hello!
  
Some more interesting projects are collated here! This time an [open centrifuge](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/openfuge/ "OpenFuge") project where all materials cost ~200 dollars, an [optogenetics wiki page](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/optogenetics/ "Optogenetics") for information and know-how exchange and last but not least, the [hack-a-day](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/learning-sources/ "LearningÂ sources") project, where excelent projects are shared. Although not always related to science, they are a great source for ideas and information (I found the OpenFuge project via their page).
