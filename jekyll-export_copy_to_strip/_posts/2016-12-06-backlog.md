On an attempt to make things even more open at Openeuroscience.com and take a little bit of the publishing delay away, we&#8217;ve decided to create the [backlog page.](http://openeuroscience.com/backlog/) 

In this page you&#8217;ll find all projects that we are planning to upload to the website but didn&#8217;t get a chance yet! This way we are not stopping the information spread, and people get to make comments about the projects before they are curated.<figure id="attachment_1327" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
