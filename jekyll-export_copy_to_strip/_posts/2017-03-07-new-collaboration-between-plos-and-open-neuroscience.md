We are happy to announce that a new Open Source toolkit channel went live today at https://channels.plos.org/open-source-toolkit.
  
This channel is a joint collaboration from [Open Neuroscience](http://openeuroscience.com), [Trend in Africa](http://trendinafrica.org) and [PLOS](http://plos.org). There you will find several open source projects related to science. They range all disciplines and comprehend both software and hardware. It is open for suggestions and interaction from the community!<figure id="attachment_1371" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">
