This update brings whatever I could find on crowdfunding portals that allow scientists to raise money for research in an innovative, decentralized way! Learn to make your research appealing to the general public and get them directly involved in it!

On top of facilitating research funding, this idea helps to take science out of its ivory tower and communicate to the public in a direct way. On the down side, &#8220;properly sold&#8221; projects can be fully funded even though they are not scientifically sound (there are solutions to this problem already&#8230;)

More information can be found [HERE.](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/crowd-funding/ "CrowdÂ funding")

Good luck with funding!
