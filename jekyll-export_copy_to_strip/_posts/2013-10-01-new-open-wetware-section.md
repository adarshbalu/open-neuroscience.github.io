Hello!
  
A new section has been added to the website! In the [wetware section](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/open-wetware/ "OpenÂ Wetware") you&#8217;ll find two projects. One of them a company selling molecular biology tools and reagents following the open source philosophy, and the other a wiki page making an effort to share information, know-how and to provide a place where people can share and organize their data/lab annotations.
