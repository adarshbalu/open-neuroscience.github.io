This is not on the neuroscience field, but it is nonetheless a major step towards open science!

On November 2014 the CERN has launched its [open data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/), where researchers, students and people interested in physics will be able to play around and visualize data generated by the large hadron collider (LHC). For both analysis and visualization the consortium has released open source software, distributed under creative common licenses. The data currently available was collected in 2010 when the collider was turned on for the first time. The European organization is committed to releasing the data collected with a 3 year delay, after it has been thoroughly analysed by its scientists.

The full press release can be found [here.](http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2014/11/cern-makes-public-first-data-lhc-experiments)
