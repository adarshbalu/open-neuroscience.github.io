We&#8217;ve been working in collaboration with the folks of TrendinAfrica (trendinafrica.org) to develop a cheap, yet reliable, open source microscopy system to be used by scientists and DIY biologists. It is called Flypi, since its original focus were experiments with _Drosophila_ and it uses the Raspberry pi computer as its &#8220;brains&#8221;.
  
The project has been going quite well and we feel it is mature enough to gain some public attention (and hopefully adoption!) and also to enter the hackaday.io competition, which would help us further develop it! So please, visit the project page, share it with your networks and show us some love by giving us &#8220;skulls&#8221; @ https://hackaday.io/project/5059-flypi-100-microscopeexperimental-setup.
