Some new projects ranging from molecular biology to distributed computation

[IPipete](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/software/ipipet/ "IPipet"): if you are tired of pipetting samples in the wrong wells and can&#8217;t afford a pipetting computer, this project is for you!

[NiBabel](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/software/data-analysis-and-visualization/nipy/nibabel/ "NiBabel"): an universal reader for fMRI data formats

[Open syringe pump1](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/wetware/916-2/open-source-syringe-pump/ "Open syringe pump 1") and [open syringe pump2](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/wetware/916-2/open-source-syringe-pump/ "Open syringe pump 1"): need to have precise infusion rates? these projects will help.

[Boinc:](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/supercomputers/boinc/ "Boinc") volunteer computing platform, where one can harness the idle time of computer for number crushing
