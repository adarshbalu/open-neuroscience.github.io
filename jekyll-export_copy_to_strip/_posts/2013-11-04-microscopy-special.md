Hi! After a brief quiet period, some new open source projects have been added to the website! This time, they are all concerning microscopy!

On the hardware list:

[Scanning electron microscope](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/microscopy-hardware/scanning-electron-microscope/ "Scanning electron microscope") (yep, you read it correctly!).

[10$ mount to transform a smartphone into a stereomicroscope.](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/microscopy-hardware/10-microscope-using-a-smartphone/ "10$ microscope using a smartphone")

[3 projects to enhance the capabilities of your commercially available stereomicroscope.

On Software:

[Micro Manager](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/software/microscopy/micro-manager/ "Micro-Manager"), a ImageJ add on that enables automatic control of several microscopes, cameras, filters and more!
