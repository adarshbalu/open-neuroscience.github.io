Hi!

Some updates for the already existing pages of the website:

Faculty of a 1000, thickens the list of [open access journals](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/open-access-journals/ "Open access journals"). One of the strong points is that they change the way peer reviewed is done. Here, the review process is a non-anonymous way and post publication! All changes made to the paper are tracked, so one can check the paper&#8217;s evolution. Also it is mandatory that the data used in the paper is made publicly available (also on the journal website).

[Figshare and dryad](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/data-collaboration-projects/ "Open Data/Data collaboration projects") are two data repositories that give your data digital object identifiers, making them traceable and citable.

[Open lab notebook](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/open-lab-notebooks/ "Open lab notebooks") section: There are still very few examples, so suggestions are welcome!

Also, Openeuroscience is now on Twitter! so if you want to follow our updates and get quick messages on cool stuff we find here and there [follow us](https://twitter.com/openeuroscience)!
