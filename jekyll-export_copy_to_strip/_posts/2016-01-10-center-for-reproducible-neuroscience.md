The [Center for reproducible Neuroscience](http://reproducibility.stanford.edu/) was founded in 2015 with the aim of helping researchers make their science stand the test of time, by making it more open and reproducible (aka better science). The starting point of the center is neuroimaging, as they provide computational power, databanks for storing and sharing data and data analysis platform (to be launched in 2016), tuned to the field.
