[Open notebooks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_notebook_science) are opening up science in the very first steps, making records of ideas, plans that didn&#8217;t work and protocols that failed available publicly. This allows others to avoid trailing the same dead end roads, saving time, money and human power. Some examples are listed below, but unfortunately there weren&#8217;t enough examples in the neuroscience field (until 22/01/14), so examples from all fields are listed:
