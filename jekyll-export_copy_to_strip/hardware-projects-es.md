Here you will find information about existing open hardware platforms, which can be used for several different tasks.

&nbsp;

There are projects such as the [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/), or the [SimpleCortex](http://www.brc-electronics.nl/), which are microcontrollers that can be loaded with different programs to control different sensors and devices.

&nbsp;

Other projects that aim to offer a cheap alternative for desktops, while doing more than desktops&#8230; Good examples in this category are the [Beagle board](http://beagleboard.org/#&slider1=1) and the [Raspberry pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) (although the latter is not completely open).

&nbsp;

On the wetware class, we have open PCR, and centrifuges available

&nbsp;

Last but not least, there are also complete electrophysiology systems available. In this category are the [Backyard brains](https://backyardbrains.com/) and the [Open ephys](http://open-ephys.org/) initiative.
