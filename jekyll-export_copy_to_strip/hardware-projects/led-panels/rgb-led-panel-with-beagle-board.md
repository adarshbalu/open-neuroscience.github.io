This project uses a 32X32 LED array (1024 LEDs in total) and a beagle bone black board. The [page describing the project](http://bikerglen.com/projects/lighting/led-panel-1up/) has very nice explanations on how the whole system works (and LED displays in general).

From this project the creator Glen Akins, went on to construct a [3X2 matrix of 32X32 LEDS,](http://bikerglen.com/blog/expanding-the-beaglebone-black-and-fpga-to-drive-6-or-more-panels/) or a total of 6144 RGB LEDs that have a 200Hz refresh rate! Check out the video below of the panel in action:
