The idea behind [3D printing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing) is simple: A machine that is able to move in 3 directions, deposits a certain material on a platform according to a model generated with a computer, so that in the end, from raw materials, one gets a fully formed object, that previously only existed on the computer screen.

On the open source community these machines have been thriving and there are several models out there, with differences on the material they use to create the objects (plastic, metal, [live tissue](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/12/131218100227.htm), [edibles](https://chocedge.com/3dprinting.php), resins), the way materials are deposited, and build complexity. The plans for building one can be downloaded for free, or kits can be bought (as in 19/02/14) for as little as 400€.

On the research framework, these machines can be used to print customizable lab equipment, such as a [lab jack](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:28298), [lens holder](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:62693), [motorized micropositioners,](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:239105) and [micropippetes](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:159052). A good source of freely available models can be found at [thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/).

Some examples of available printers are (the list is definitely, much bigger and not all printers listed here are open source):

**Plastic deposition printers:**

[RepRap](http://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap): The reprap is an open source project that hosts a family of printers, varying in build complexity and print volume. &#8220;The RepRap is humanity&#8217;s first general-purpose [self-replicating manufacturing machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replicating_machine "wikipedia:Self-replicating machine")&#8220;, since a lot of the parts that compose the printers are 3D printed.

[k8200:](http://www.k8200.eu/home/)  Sold as a kit by the Velleman company, the k8200 has a print volume of 20X20X20 cm.

[printrbot](http://printrbot.com/): This is one one of the many spinoff the RepRap project (also open source), it started out as a [kickstarter](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/crowd-funding/ "Crowd funding") campaign, focusing on being the first 3D printer under U$500.00.

[Makerbot](http://www.makerbot.com/): Has a family of already assembled 3D printers and 3D Scanners.

[Ultimaker](https://www.ultimaker.com/): Open source 3D printers. They have a pretty neat print resolution, that allows some very [nice prints.](http://davedurant.wordpress.com/2011/10/12/ultimaker-faq-but-what-about-the-quality-of-prints/)

[Deezmaker](http://deezmaker.com/): This company offers more than one printer and they also run classes on arduino, 3d printing software and others.

[Terawatt industries](http://www.terawattindustries.com/): They offer a range of printers, some original designs and some terawatt flavour of already established printers

**3D stereolithography printers:**

[Peachyprinter](http://www.peachyprinter.com/): Although not in the market yet (19/02/14, they are still managing products for their crowdfunding campaigns), the project aims, via a very clever design, to bring down the costs of a 3D printer to the U$100.00 line.

[Form 1](http://formlabs.com/): On the high price spectrum.

[B9creator](http://b9creator.com/): Open source printer, their website host a store and also the blueprinters, so you can build one of these yourself.

[Here is a DIY project.](http://www.instructables.com/id/Build-a-Laser-3D-Printer-Stereolithography-at-Ho/)

**Metal printers:**

The group of Prof. Joshua Pearce has developed an [open source metal 3D printer](http://www.appropedia.org/Open-source_metal_3-D_printer). A publication on IEEE can be found [here](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6678531).

**3D print on demand**

If you don&#8217;t want to buy a 3D printer you can also get 3D prints on demand. Below are links for companies that will print a 3D model for you:

http://www.shapeways.com/

http://www.sculpteo.com/en/

www.meltwerk.com

www.trinckle.com

https://www.3dhubs.com/ &#8211; Not exactly a company, but a hub that logs printers of random people willing to print pieces for a fee
