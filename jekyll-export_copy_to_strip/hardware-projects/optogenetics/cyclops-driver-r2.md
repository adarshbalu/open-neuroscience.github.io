The [Cyclops Driver R2](https://potterlab.gatech.edu/main/newman/wiki/index.php?title=Cyclops_Driver_R2) is a PCB that can drive high power LEDs. It has been used primary for optogenetic stimulation of neurons, but it can be used to drive LEDs for any application where a fast switching, ultra-stable, and high power light source is required (e.g. fluorescent imaging).

There is a newer review (R3) of the project, but the [page](https://potterlab.gatech.edu/main/newman/wiki/index.php?title=Cyclops_Driver_R3) is not updated yet (23.07.2013)
