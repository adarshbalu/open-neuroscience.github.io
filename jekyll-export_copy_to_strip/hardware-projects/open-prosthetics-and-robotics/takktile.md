[Takktile](http://www.takktile.com/), is a tactile sensor to be used on robotic applications. The developers want to make it move away from the closed walls of research institutions by making it open source and cheap. It is built based on MEMs barometers and can sense 1 gram loads as well as coping with hammer blows (see video from their website below).
