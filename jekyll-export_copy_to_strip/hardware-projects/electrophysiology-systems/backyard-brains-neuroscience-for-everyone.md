[The backyard brains](https://backyardbrains.com/) company started out producing low cost, portable, electrophysiology systems to bring neuroscience to classrooms and help promote it. &#8220;Backyard brains wants to be for neuroscience, what the telescope is for astronomers&#8221; &#8211; meaning that the idea is that with a couple of hundred dollars anyone can get one of these recording systems and start doing experiments, like amateur astronomers can buy telescopes and start observing the cosmos.

Up to now, they have tutorials on several experiments, a microsimulation device and a robotroach preparation.
