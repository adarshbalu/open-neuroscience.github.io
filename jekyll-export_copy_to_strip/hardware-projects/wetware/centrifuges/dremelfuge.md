[DremelFuge](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1483) is a very simple and clever centrifuge. It takes advantage of 3d printing technology to print an adaptor that goes on to a Dremel (a precision tool that has really high rotation rates). It was created by [Cathal](http://www.thingiverse.com/cathalgarvey/about)
