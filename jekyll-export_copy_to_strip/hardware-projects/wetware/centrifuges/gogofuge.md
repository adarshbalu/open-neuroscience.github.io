[GogoFuge](http://diybio.org/2012/06/12/gogofuge/) is a good example of the power of opensource designs. IT was based on the idea of the [DremelFuge](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/wetware/centrifuges/dremelfuge/ "DremelFuge") and altered to be a tabletop centrifuge with vortex capability. It was created by [Keegan Cooke](http://fablabatschool.org/profile/KeeganCooke)
