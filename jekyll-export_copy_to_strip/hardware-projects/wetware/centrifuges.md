In this section you&#8217;ll find projects for open source centrifuges:

[DremelFuge](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/wetware/centrifuges/dremelfuge/ "DremelFuge") &#8211; a very simple centrifuge that uses a Dremel and a 3D printed base where to place eppendorfs

[GogoFuge](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/wetware/centrifuges/gogofuge/ "GogoFuge") &#8211; an adaptation of the Dremel Fuge, turning it into a tabletop centrifuge with added vortex capabilities

[OpenFuge](http://openeuroscience.wordpress.com/hardware-projects/wetware/centrifuges/openfuge/ "OpenFuge") &#8211; another tabletop centrifuge, similar to the GogoFuge
