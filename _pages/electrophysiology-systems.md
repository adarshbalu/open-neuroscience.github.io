Electrophysiology systems are systems developed for recording the very small signals (action potentials or local field potentials) neurons use to communicate. Normally they cost in the range of 50 up to hundreds of thousands of euros, which make them prohibitive for most labs and also confined to lab space. Two open source alternatives are available, costing much less, and being more portable.
