On the Words of Marco (one of the founders of the project) openQCM:

<span style="color:#339966;">openQCM is the first open hardware Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) with applications in a wide range of scientific fields,</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">such as chemical and biological sensing, material science.</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">The sensing core is a piezoelectric quartz crystal oscillator. The deposition on the quartz surface of a very tiny mass (down to 1 billionth of gram)</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">causes the variation in the quartz frequency.</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">It has an Arduino board plus a custom electronic for driving the quartz resonator.</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">The hardware case is made using 3D-printing technology.</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">openQCM was built keeping in mind the emergent principles of the open source hardware movement,</span>
  
 <span style="color:#339966;">so that anyone (scientists, technology enthusiast, makers, hobbyist …) can study, modify, and develop the hardware based on the original design</span>
