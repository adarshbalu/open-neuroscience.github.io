In fields related to vision, stimulus presentation is always an issue due to slow refresh rates on commercial monitors/projectors. One way to circumvent this problem is to use LEDs Â arranged in a matrix to present stimuli, that can be driven at much higher refresh rates, but have a worst resolution than monitors. Below two examples of such panels:
