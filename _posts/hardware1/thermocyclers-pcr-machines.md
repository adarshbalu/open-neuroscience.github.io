PCR Machines are one of the working horses of most life science labs. They cost quite a lot (~3500 dollars and up) but are very simple machines that simply heat up samples to a certain temperature for a determined amount of time and than cool them down to another temperature for another amount of time. This cycle is then repeated for ~100 times. Here you can find some examples of these machines from an open source company and DIY enthusiasts:
