This project was developed by [Katherine Scott](http://www.kscottz.com/about/) to be presented at the PyCon 2014. She developed a skinner box for her pet rats using a raspberry pi and some 3D printed parts. The setup contain a food dispenser, a buzzer, levers, a camera to observe the animals and it is hooked in a way that everything can be controlled over the internet!

You can find the files for 3D parts [here](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:296335) and a better description of the project [here](http://www.kscottz.com/open-skinner-box-pycon-2014/)
